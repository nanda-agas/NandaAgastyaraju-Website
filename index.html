        <div class="subheading mb-5">Marketing</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am a freshman at the University of California, Riverside. I graduated from Oak Park High School, located in Oak Park, California, in June 2020. I am very excited to be going to this school—my major in Marketing with a double major either in Psychology or Sociology. I am hoping to graduate within 4 years of staying at this school. Over my high school year, I had held multiple internships and volunteer positions. <br><br>

        During the summer of 11th grade, I worked at a company called OnTrack Solutions. OnTrack solutions were a company based in Woodland Hills, California. While there, I was a marketing intern where I had to create fun animations and videos to sell their products. The product we sold at OnTrack solutions advertising for a business. But I was quickly promoted to Project Manager. While in this position, I had the responsibilities of learning a program that made it easier for my boss to pay his staff easier for all their tasks. During this process of learning branch out my experience just from creating videos to managing a project.
During the same summer I held a potion as a Volunteer at Kaiser Permanent in Woodland Hills California. I worked in the Oncology department where I took care of all the phone calls that came true and took care of patients' personal needs during their stay at the hospital. I had always thought of going into the medical field, but everything changed when I actually knew that college was coming up fast and I had now I idea what to expect. But one thing was that I no way I wanted to study for another 12 years of my life. But at that time, I still wanted to go into the medical field, so I decided to pursue another volunteer position. I got a position at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, California. I was super excited to meet new people and just get to know them a lot more. This is where I adapted to meeting new people and my real extroverted personality came out.
<br><br>

        I worked at the Hospital throughout my junior and senior year. But everything got stopped due to the Corona Virus. Then rest of the school year passed by really quickly and I gradated on June 4, 2020. Fast forward 6 months I recently got a job at Vector marketing. The basic jest of this company is that I am a sales representative and I have to sell cutlery and other kitchen products to customers that want to buy Cutco. I work under the company Cutco and I really excited to. I recently made my first sale and I just finished training on November 13, 2020. I am excited to continue my journey in this company and hope to see future endeavor in my marketing career.
